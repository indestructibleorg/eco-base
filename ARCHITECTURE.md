# AutoEcoOps Ecosystem v1.0 - Enterprise Architecture

## Executive Summary

AutoEcoOps Ecosystem represents a comprehensive enterprise-grade DevOps platform designed to unify observability, automation, and infrastructure management across three specialized operational domains. The architecture follows a layered approach with a shared kernel providing cross-cutting concerns (authentication, event streaming, policy enforcement, audit trails) and three independent platforms addressing distinct operational challenges.

**Technology Stack**: OPA/Kyverno, PostgreSQL with Append-only mode, S3 Object Lock

## Enterprise-Grade Capabilities

### Observability Requirements

The platform enforces structured logging with mandatory fields: `timestamp`, `traceId`, `spanId`, `service`, `platformId`, `action`, `decision`. All metrics are exposed in OpenMetrics format with defined SLOs: availability ≥99.99%, P95 latency ≤200ms, error rate ≤0.1%. Distributed tracing captures 100% of critical paths with full context preservation.

### Supply Chain Security

The platform achieves SLSA Build Level 3 compliance through isolated build processes, artifact signature generation, and reproducible builds. Every artifact includes a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in CycloneDX format, signed with cosign. Pre-deployment validation ensures signature validity, zero high-risk vulnerabilities, and license compliance.

### Disaster Recovery & Resilience

Multi-cluster deployment supports both Active-Active and Active-Standby topologies. Audit data and event streams replicate across regions with RPO ≤1 hour and RTO ≤15 minutes. Database backups encrypt and store across geographically distributed locations.

### Compliance & Audit

All audit logs store in immutable storage (Object Lock or Append-only databases). Each audit event includes operator identity, resource identifier, action type, result status, policy version, and compliance tags. Automated compliance report generation supports SOC2 and ISO27001 certification workflows.

## Data Flow Patterns

### Synchronous Request Flow

1. User/System initiates API call to Platform-01
2. Auth Service validates identity and permissions
3. Platform queries Memory Hub for contextual information
4. Business logic execution with policy enforcement
5. Synchronous write to Policy & Audit service
6. API response returned to caller

### Asynchronous Event Flow

1. Platform generates event with traceId, actor, resource, policy decision
2. Event publishes to Event Bus
3. Event Bus routes to subscribed platforms
4. Subscribers process events with result tracking
5. Processing results audit to Policy & Audit service
6. Event replay and deduplication support

## Kubernetes Deployment Model

The platform deploys on Kubernetes with the following resource organization:

- **core namespace**: Shared kernel services (auth, memory hub, event bus, policy audit)
- **platform-01 namespace**: IndestructibleAutoOps services
- **platform-02 namespace**: IAOps services
- **platform-03 namespace**: MachineNativeOps services
- **observability namespace**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Alertmanager

Each namespace includes:

- Deployments with resource requests/limits
- Services for internal and external access
- ConfigMaps for configuration management
- Secrets for credential management
- HorizontalPodAutoscalers for dynamic scaling
- PodDisruptionBudgets for high availability

## Security Model

### Network Security

- Service mesh (Istio) for encrypted inter-service communication
- NetworkPolicies for microsegmentation
- Ingress with TLS termination
- API gateway for rate limiting and authentication

### Data Security

- Encryption at rest (AES-256) for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Key rotation policies for secrets
- Database encryption with customer-managed keys

### Access Control

- RBAC with least privilege principle
- Service accounts with minimal permissions
- API key rotation and revocation
- Audit logging of all access events

## Deployment Environments

The platform supports three deployment environments with progressive hardening:

**Development**: Single-node Kubernetes cluster with relaxed resource limits, simplified networking, and verbose logging for rapid iteration.

**Staging**: Multi-node cluster with production-like configuration, full observability stack, and realistic data volumes for pre-production validation.

**Production**: Multi-region, multi-cluster deployment with active-active replication, comprehensive monitoring, automated failover, and strict compliance enforcement.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy shared kernel services (Auth, Memory Hub, Event Bus, Policy & Audit)
2. Implement Platform-01 observability and self-healing capabilities
3. Establish Platform-02 GitOps workflows and compliance validation
4. Deploy Platform-03 node management and edge agents
5. Configure observability stack and SLO tracking
6. Validate supply chain security and compliance requirements
